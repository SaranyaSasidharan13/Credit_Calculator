# Credit_Calculator

Description
Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes several parameters like a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.
Let's compute all the parameters of the loan. There are at least two kinds of loan: those with annuity payment and those with differentiated payment.

Objective
1. The user specifies all the known parameters with command-line arguments, and one parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.
2. Handling of invalid parameters. It's a good idea to show an error message if the user enters invalid parameters
